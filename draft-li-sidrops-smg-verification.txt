Signed MOAS Group (SMG) Based Route Origin Verification and Operational
                             Considerations
                draft-li-sidrops-smg-verification-latest

Abstract

   The Signed MOAS Group (SMG) is a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
   protected content type that allows multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes)
   to collaboratively and securely announce an IP prefix in the Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP).  This document specifies the SMG-based Route
   Origin Verification (SMG-ROV) methodology, designed to enhance the
   security of multi-origin AS (MOAS) scenarios in the BGP.  By
   combining SMG-ROV with ROA-based ROV (ROA-ROV), the document provides
   a mechanism to distinguish between legitimate MOAS and malicious
   prefix hijacks, thereby mitigating prefix hijacks and AS forgery.
   The document also explains the various BGP security threats that SMG
   can help address and provides operational considerations associated
   with SMG-ROV deployment.
